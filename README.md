This project aims to provide a foundation for building a client-side login system with Supabase/SSR using Next.js 14 and TypeScript. It demonstrates how to:

Set up a Next.js project with TypeScript.
Use Supabase for authentication using @supabase/ssr and @supabase/supabase-js.
Create a simple login page and handle user authentication.
Optionally, protect routes that require authentication.

npm run dev
